      <Facts>
        
      
        <Paragraph id="Fletcher_v_Peck.Facts.p001">In 1795, the Georgia legislature passed an act granting approximately 35 million acres of land in present-day Alabama and Mississippi to four companies, including the Georgia Company, for $500,000. The grant was procured through widespread bribery of legislators, with company representatives promising legislators shares in the land if they voted for the bill. In 1796, a newly elected Georgia legislature, responding to public outrage over the corruption, passed an act rescinding the 1795 grant, declaring it null and void, and directing that all records of the original act be expunged. However, before the rescinding act, innocent third parties had already purchased portions of the land. Robert Fletcher purchased 15,000 acres from John Peck in 1803, with Peck's deed containing covenants that Georgia had authority to sell the land and that the title had not been constitutionally impaired by any subsequent act of the legislature.</Paragraph>
        
      
        <Paragraph id="Fletcher_v_Peck.Facts.p002">Fletcher subsequently sued Peck in the U.S. Circuit Court for the District of Massachusetts, alleging breach of these covenants based on the corruption in the original grant and Georgia's 1796 rescinding act. The circuit court ruled in favor of Peck on all counts, finding that the pleas were sufficient and that Georgia was seised in fee simple of the lands at the time of the original grant. Fletcher brought a writ of error to the U.S. Supreme Court.</Paragraph>

      <Holding>
        
      
        <Paragraph id="Fletcher_v_Peck.Holding.p001">A state legislature cannot rescind a land grant made by a previous legislature, even if the original grant was obtained through corruption, because such a rescission would violate the Contract Clause of the U.S. Constitution. Chief Justice John Marshall authored the unanimous 4-2 majority opinion of the Court.</Paragraph>
        
      
        <Paragraph id="Fletcher_v_Peck.Holding.p002">The Contract Clause prohibits states from passing any law &quot;impairing the Obligation of Contracts,&quot; and a land grant from a state to private purchasers constitutes a binding contract that vests absolute property rights in the grantees. Once Georgia conveyed the land through the 1795 act, it created a contract that transferred complete ownership to the purchasers, and the state's rights to the property were entirely extinguished. The fact that the original grant may have been procured through bribery or corruption does not change this constitutional protection, as innocent third-party purchasers who bought the land without knowledge of the corruption have legitimate vested rights that cannot be destroyed by subsequent legislative action.</Paragraph>
        
      
        <Paragraph id="Fletcher_v_Peck.Holding.p003">Furthermore, the Constitution's Contract Clause applies to contracts made by states themselves, not just private contracts, and states cannot exempt themselves from this constitutional limitation by claiming sovereign authority. While legislatures generally have broad powers to repeal their own acts, they cannot undo a completed contract that has already conveyed property rights, as this would retroactively destroy vested interests in violation of fundamental principles of law and the constitutional protection of contracts. The 1796 rescinding act was therefore void as an unconstitutional impairment of contract obligations.</Paragraph>
        
      
        <Paragraph id="Fletcher_v_Peck.Holding.p004">Justice William Johnson authored a concurring opinion, agreeing with the result but basing his reasoning on general principles of law rather than specifically on the Contract Clause.</Paragraph>

      <Question>Fletcher's suit against Peck was predicated on a breach of specific covenants in the 1803 deed. Based on the facts presented, articulate the two distinct legal arguments Fletcher would have advanced, linking each to a specific covenant and a specific legislative act.</Question>
      <Answer>Fletcher's first argument, tied to the covenant that Georgia had the authority to sell the land, would assert that the original 1795 grant was void ab initio due to the widespread bribery and corruption used to procure it. This would imply Georgia never possessed the legal capacity to convey valid title to the companies, and consequently, Peck could not transfer a legitimate title to Fletcher. His second argument, linked to the covenant that the title had not been constitutionally impaired by a subsequent legislative act, would contend that even if the 1795 grant was initially valid, the 1796 rescinding act passed by the new Georgia legislature constitutionally nullified the grant, thereby impairing the title Peck purported to convey.</Answer>

      <Question>The Court's holding addresses the tension between a legislature's general power to repeal its own acts and the specific nature of the 1795 Georgia grant. According to Chief Justice Marshall's reasoning, what jurisprudential distinction separates a repealable legislative act from an unrepealable one, such as the land grant in this case?</Question>
      <Answer>According to Marshall's reasoning, the critical jurisprudential distinction lies in whether the legislative act constitutes a general law or one that creates a completed contract conveying vested property rights. While legislatures generally possess broad authority to repeal their own acts, they are precluded from undoing an act that functions as a contract once it has been executed and property rights have been conveyed. The 1795 grant was not merely a statute but a contract that transferred complete ownership to the purchasers, extinguishing the state's rights. Repealing such an act would retroactively destroy vested interests, which is prohibited by the Contract Clause.</Answer>

      <Question>While the Court's decision was unanimous, Justice Johnson's concurrence offered a different legal foundation for the outcome. Contrast the specific constitutional basis of Chief Justice Marshall's majority opinion with the jurisprudential source of Justice Johnson's reasoning.</Question>
      <Answer>Chief Justice Marshall's majority opinion is explicitly grounded in the U.S. Constitution, specifically the Contract Clause (Article I, Section 10), which prohibits states from passing any law 'impairing the Obligation of Contracts.' He found the 1796 rescinding act to be a direct violation of this clause. In contrast, Justice Johnson, while concurring in the judgment, based his reasoning not on a specific constitutional provision but on 'general principles of law,' suggesting a foundation in natural law or fundamental legal principles that exist independent of the written Constitution to protect vested property rights from legislative interference.</Answer>

      <Question>The holding establishes that the Contract Clause applies to contracts made by states themselves. How does the Court's opinion address the potential argument that a state, as a sovereign entity, cannot be bound by this constitutional limitation in the same manner as private parties?</Question>
      <Answer>The Court's opinion explicitly rejects the notion that a state's sovereign authority exempts it from the Contract Clause. The holding states that the Constitution's prohibition against impairing contract obligations applies to contracts made by states themselves, not solely to private contracts. By ruling that Georgia could not rescind its own grant, the Court established that states cannot utilize their legislative power to unilaterally abrogate contractual obligations they have entered into, thereby subordinating the state's claim of sovereign power to this constitutional limitation in this context.</Answer>

      <Question>The case involves two key legislative acts: the 1795 grant and the 1796 rescinding act. How did the Supreme Court's interpretation of the legal status and effect of the 1795 act render the 1796 act unconstitutional?</Question>
      <Answer>The Supreme Court interpreted the 1795 act not as a mere legislative enactment but as a fully executed contract that conveyed vested, absolute property rights from the state of Georgia to the private purchasers. Once this contract was completed, the Court reasoned, the state's rights to the property were 'entirely extinguished.' Because the 1795 act created a binding contractual obligation, the subsequent 1796 rescinding act, which attempted to nullify this completed transaction, was deemed an unconstitutional 'law impairing the Obligation of Contracts' in direct violation of the Contract Clause.</Answer>

      <Question>The presence of 'innocent third parties' is a critical factual element. According to the holding, what is the legal significance of Fletcher's status as an innocent third-party purchaser in the Court's analysis of the original grant's alleged corruption?</Question>
      <Answer>The legal significance is that it renders the original corruption irrelevant to the constitutional question. The Court's holding explicitly states that the fact the original grant may have been procured through bribery 'does not change this constitutional protection.' The focus shifts from the corrupt origins of the grant to the 'legitimate vested rights' of innocent third-party purchasers who acquired the land without knowledge of the corruption. The Court determined that these rights cannot be destroyed by a subsequent legislative act, effectively prioritizing the stability of contracts and the protection of bona fide purchasers over the state's attempt to remedy its own prior legislative malfeasance.</Answer>

      <Question>The case arrived at the Supreme Court on a writ of error from the U.S. Circuit Court for the District of Massachusetts. What was the specific ruling of the circuit court, and how did the Supreme Court's decision relate to that lower court's judgment?</Question>
      <Answer>The U.S. Circuit Court for the District of Massachusetts had ruled in favor of John Peck on all counts. It found that Peck's pleas were sufficient and specifically determined that Georgia was 'seised in fee simple of the lands at the time of the original grant.' The Supreme Court's decision affirmed the judgment of the circuit court. By ruling unanimously in favor of Peck, the Supreme Court upheld the lower court's outcome, although it did so by providing a definitive constitutional rationale based on the Contract Clause.</Answer>

      <Question>The holding states that the 1795 grant 'vests absolute property rights in the grantees.' Based on the context of the Court's reasoning regarding the 1796 rescinding act, what does the term 'vested' signify in this legal context?</Question>
      <Answer>In this legal context, 'vested' signifies that the property rights were fully and unconditionally transferred to the grantees, becoming their secure and settled possession. The term implies that the rights were no longer contingent or subject to being divested by a future act of the grantor (the legislature). The Court's reasoning emphasizes that because the rights were vested through a completed contract, they could not be retroactively destroyed or 'undone' by the 1796 rescinding act, as this would violate the fundamental principle of protecting established, legitimate interests under the Contract Clause.</Answer>

      <Question>The central issue is framed as whether a state can cancel land grants involving innocent third parties. How does the Court's holding broaden the principle beyond the specific facts of this issue to establish a more general rule about state legislative power?</Question>
      <Answer>While the involvement of innocent third parties was a compelling factual element, the Court's holding establishes a much broader principle. The holding declares that a state legislature cannot rescind a land grant made by a previous legislature because such a grant is a contract protected by the Constitution. The core reasoning is that a state is bound by the Contract Clause for any contract it makes, and it cannot pass a law impairing its own contractual obligations, regardless of the original grant's potential corruption. The principle is not limited to protecting only innocent third parties; it establishes a general rule that a state's executed grant is a binding contract that extinguishes the state's rights and cannot be legislatively revoked.</Answer>

      <Question>Analyze the procedural posture of the case. Why was Fletcher, the plaintiff who initiated the lawsuit, also the party bringing the writ of error to the Supreme Court?</Question>
      <Answer>Fletcher was the party bringing the writ of error because he was the losing party in the lower court. He initiated the lawsuit against Peck in the U.S. Circuit Court for the District of Massachusetts. The circuit court, however, ruled in favor of the defendant, Peck, on all counts. A writ of error is a procedural device used by the losing party in a lower court to ask a higher court to review the judgment for alleged errors of law. Therefore, as the plaintiff who lost at the circuit court level, Fletcher was the one to petition the U.S. Supreme Court to review and reverse the lower court's decision.</Answer>
